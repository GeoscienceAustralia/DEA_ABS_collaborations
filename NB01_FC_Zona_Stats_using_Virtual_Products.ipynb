    "This notebook is a pilot collaboration between Geoscience Australia and Australian Bureau of Statistics. The purpose of the notebook is to use a shapefile polygon boundaries to load fractional cover dataset, complete zonal statistics and tabulate the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to run the following commands from the command line prior to launching jupyter notebooks from the same terminal so that the required libraries and paths are set:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Background**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data from the Landsat 5,7 and 8 satellite missions are accessible through Digital Earth Australia (DEA). The code snippets in this notebook will let you retrieve and plot the Fractional Cover (FC25) data stored in DEA.\n",

    "**How to use this notebook**\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic understanding of any programming language is desirable but one doesn't have to be an expert Python programmer to manipulate the code to get and display the data.This doc applies to the following Landsat satellites, Fractional Cover bands and the WOfS dataset:\n",
